Be extremely concise. Sacrifice concision for the sake of grammar. 
After finishing major tasks, ask whether you should write some notes somewhere.
No need to tell me I am absolutely right.

Main repository state should always be 'clean' and working to be able to launch experiments. 
When developing a new feature, or starting to work on a new issue etc. always create a worktree to avoid polluting the main repository state.
